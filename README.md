# score.js
A lightweight, open-source, jQuery like framework.

## Building
Run the file `buildTools.jar` to 'compile' score.js into one single file. For more information on using buildTools,
or to view / edit the source code, visit it's repository, [buildTools](https://github.com/Wobblyyyy/buildtools).

## Using
It's pretty similar to jQuery in a lot of regards. To say the least, it was definitely inspired by jQuery, but with
different goals in mind - primarily, being a smaller and more lightweight implementation of many of the features which make
jQuery so useful.
